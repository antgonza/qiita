    Qiita is a development effort powering the data analysis and storage for the Human Microbiome Project phase two of the Human Microbiome Project, a new three-year "multi-omic" study investigating the roles played by microbes and their interactions with the human body. Using inflammatory bowel disease as our focus, this project will delve into the relationship between the microbiome and disease.
